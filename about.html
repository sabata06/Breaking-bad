          Breaking Bad is an American crime drama television series created and
          produced by Vince Gilligan. Set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico,
          the series follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underpaid,
          overqualified, and dispirited high-school chemistry teacher who is
          struggling with a recent diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer. White
          turns to a life of crime and partners with a former student, Jesse
          Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to produce and distribute methamphetamine to
          secure his family's financial future before he dies, while navigating
          the dangers of the criminal underworld. The show aired on AMC from
          January 20, 2008, to September 29, 2013, consisting of five seasons
          for a total of 62 episodes.

          <h3>SEASON 1</h3>
          <h6>Vince Gilligan</h6>
          <p>
            On his 50th birthday, during his surprise party, Walt watches a news
            report about Hank arresting methamphetamine dealers. Walt is
            impressed by the monetary returns from the meth operation, and Hank
            offers to take him as a ride-along to a DEA bust. The next day, Walt
            faints at the car wash and is taken to a hospital; there, he is told
            he has inoperable lung cancer and will likely die within the next
            two years.

          <h6>Bryan Cranston</h6>
          <p>
            Walt's "blue meth" becomes incredibly popular, to the point that
            Hank takes notice and raids Tuco's operation. A paranoid Tuco evades
            the bust, carjacks Jesse, and kidnaps Walt. He brings them to an
            isolated house in the desert, planning to take them deep into Mexico
            where they would be forced to cook their blue meth for the cartel.

            Walt decides to get out of the meth business, refusing Gus' offer to
            produce meth in a state-of-the-art laboratory hidden under an
            industrial laundry for a million dollars a month. Now separated from
            Skyler and living in an apartment, Walt admits to her that he has
            been financing his treatment by cooking meth. Horrified, Skyler asks
            for a divorce in return for her silence and demands that Walt have
            nothing to do with their children.

            In the aftermath of Gale's murder, Mike holds Walt at the lab to
            await Gus' arrival. Victor arrives with Jesse and proceeds to start
            the cooking process himself to show Gus that Walt and Jesse are not
            indispensable. Gus, however, kills Victor in front of Mike, Walt,
            and Jesse in a gruesome show of force.

          <p>
            Mike intends to kill Walt in retaliation for Gus' death, but Jesse
            intervenes and convinces the two men to work together to eliminate
            their connection to the destroyed lab. The three eventually start a
            new meth production system with the help of a corrupt pest control
            company, using residents' homes to cook meth while they are
            fumigated, using methylamine provided by Lydia Rodarte-Quayle (Laura
            Fraser), a representative for the conglomerate that owned Gus's
            chicken franchise.
